## Installing NGINX

NGINX Agent interfaces directly with an NGINX server process installed on the same system. If you don't have it already, follow these steps to install [NGINX Open Source](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/) or [NGINX Plus](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-plus/). Once installed, ensure the NGINX instance is running.

## Installing Go

NGINX Agent is written in Go and requires Go 1.19 or higher to be installed. You can [download Go from the official website](https://go.dev/dl/). 

## Installing Agent from Package Files

To install NGINX Agent on your system, go to [Releases](https://github.com/nginx/agent/releases) and download `nginx-agent.tar.gz`. Extract the file and locate the appropriate binary in the archive.

Depending on OS distribution and CPU architecture type, use your system's package manager to install the package. Some examples:

- Debian, Ubuntu, and other distributions using the `apt` package manager

  ```
  sudo apt install ./nginx-agent-<agent-version>.deb
  ```

- RHEL, CentOS RHEL, Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux, and other distributions using the `yum` package manager
  
  ```
  sudo yum localinstall nginx-agent-<agent-version>.rpm
  ```

- RHEL and other distributions using the `rpm` package manager

  ```
  sudo rpm -i nginx-agent-<agent-version>.rpm
  ```

- Alpine Linux

  ```
  sudo apk add nginx-agent-<agent-version>.apk
  ```

- FreeBSD
 
  ```
  sudo pkg add nginx-agent-<agent-version>
  ```

## Starting and Enabling Start on Boot

To start the NGINX Agent on `systemd` systems, run the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start nginx-agent
```
To enable the NGINX Agent to start on boot, run the following command:

```
sudo systemctl enable nginx-agent
```

## Logging 

NGINX Agent uses formatted log files to collect metrics. Expanding log formats and instance counts will also increase the size of the NGINX Agent log files. We recommend adding a separate partition for `/var/log/nginx-agent`. 

{{< important >}}Without log rotation or storage on a separate partition, log files could use up all the free drive space and cause your system to become unresponsive to certain services.{{< /important >}}
